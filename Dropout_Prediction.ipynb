    "1. ***DAG Acyclicity :*** A Bayesian Network must form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) i.e a directed graph with no cycles that ensures a valid factorization of the joint probability distribution.\n",
    "2. ***Global Independence Assertions:*** The DAG structure of a Bayesian Network implies a set of conditional independence relations statements of the form I(X, Y | Z), meaning **“X is independent of Y given Z.”** These global assertions capture every independence implied by the graph’s topology.\n",
    "3. ***Local (Markov) Semantics:*** The local Markov property states that each node is conditionally independent of its non descendants once its direct parents are known. This means that after accounting for a node’s parents, no other variables outside its ancestral line provide additional information about it.\n",
    "4. ***Active Trails and d-Separation:*** An active trail is a path through the DAG along which probabilistic influence can flow, given a set of observed (evidence) variables. d-Separation defines when two nodes are independent: if every path between them is “blocked” by the evidence (i.e., no active trails remain), they are conditionally independent. Conversely, if at least one active trail exists, information can pass and the nodes are dependent under the given evidence.\n",
    "5. ***Markov Blanket:*** The Markov blanket of a node is the minimal set (its parents, children, and its children’s other parents) that makes it independent of all other variables.  \n",
    "6.***Assertion Frequency Analysis***: By counting how often each variable appears as the “independent” side or within the evidence set across all assertions, we assess which nodes are most structurally central in driving independencies.\n",
    "7. ***Sample Assertion Checks:*** We rigorously test specific conditional-independence hypotheses by creating IndependenceAssertion(X, Y | Z) objects formalizing *“X is independent of Y given Z”* and confirming they appear in the network’s global set of implied independencies. This targeted validation ensures our learned DAG faithfully encodes the intended dependency structure and serves as a robust sanity check of its conditional independence properties."

Next, hidden variables are eliminated one at a time by summing them out of these intermediate factors. Finally, the remaining factor, defined solely over the query variable, is normalized so its probabilities sum to one, yielding the exact posterior distribution for Q given the evidence.\n"

Each sample assigns values to all variables, but evidence variables are fixed, and non-evidence variables are sampled. Every sample receives a weight equal to the product of the probabilities of the evidence variables given their sampled parents. After generating many weighted samples, the posterior distribution of the query variable Q is approximated by the normalized sum of weights for samples where Q takes each possible value. This approach focuses computational effort on regions of the sample space consistent with evidence, improving efficiency over naive sampling."
